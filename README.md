## Getting Started

Run the development server in this repository:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To change the database account (in this application I use my own MongoDB database), please open the `app.module.ts` and change the database server url through MongooseModule there.

## Note
This is my first time building Full-Stack Application so I just can make it to cover the Sign Up and Sign In process. The data in the dashboard page is still static. Thank you for your understanding.
